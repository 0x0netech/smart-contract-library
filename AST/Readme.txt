1.	“Function SetAATContrct(address _token)”,  This function can only be called by “Contract Owner”. Owner Can call this function in 	“ASTFactory” contract with parameter address of “AAT Token Contract” to create a link to call “AAT token” contract from “ASTFactory” 	contract.
2.	“function SetPoolWallet(address _wallet)” , This function can only be called by “Contract Owner”. Owner Can call this function in 	“ASTFactory” contract with parameter address of “Asset Locked Owner” wallet. This address will keep the minted “AST” token whenever 	Minted.
3.	“function CreateASTToken(string memory name_, string memory symbol_, uint256 totalSupply_ ,uint256 _ratio)”, This function can only 	be called by “Contract Owner”. Owner Can call this function to Create/Generate “AST” tokens . This Function will Generate AST tokens 	with Given totalSupply and Split into 50/50. First 50% “AST” token will mint to “AssetOwnerWallet” and other 50% will be Stored In 	“ASTFactory”. “uint256 _ratio” is the Convertion ratio Between AST to AAT and AAT to AST token.
4.	For example 1AAT=7.25 AST then user have to Pass “725” in “_ratio” parameter in “CreateASTToken” function. Another one 1AAT=70.25 	then user have to pass “7025” in “_ratio” variable. After this the amount of “AST” token minted to “ASTFactory” will be converted to 	“AAT” and minted to “PoolWallet” Address.
5.	“Function ASTConvertionAmount(address _astToken,uint256 _aatAmount)”, This function requires “AST” Token Address and “AAT” amount. 	It will return the “AST” token amount in Proportion to “AAT” amount given in parameter, and it also returns the “AST” token needs to 	burn.
6.	“function AATBurnAmount(address _astToken)”, This function requires “AST” Token address to return then “AAT” amount.
7.	“function returnAstToLockedOwner(address _astToken,uint256 _astAmount)”, This function requires “AST” token Address and “AST” token 	amount. It will called internally and transfers Converted “AST” token amount from “AAT” Token Amount to “AssetOwnerWallet”.
8.	“function burnAAT(uint256 _amount,address _astToken)”, This function requires “AAT” token amount and “AST” contract address for 	which u want to burn your “AAT” token and generate “AST” token.
9.	“function burnAstToken(address _astToken)”, This function is used by contract owner. It requires “AST” token address to burn the 	“AST” token when the “AssetOwnerWallet” got above 99% of that “AST” Token in his wallet.
